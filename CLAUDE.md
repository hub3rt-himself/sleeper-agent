# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is "rusty-nettles-ai" - a practice project for exploring various technologies and concepts. Currently, the repository is minimal with only a README.md file.

## Development Setup

No specific build system, package manager, or development commands have been configured yet. The project appears to be in its initial stages.

## Architecture

The repository structure is currently minimal:
- Root directory contains only a README.md file
- No source code, configuration files, or build artifacts present yet

## Getting Started

Since this is a practice project in early development, future development will likely involve:
- Setting up a build system (potentially Rust-based given the "rusty" prefix)
- Adding source code directories
- Configuring package management and dependencies
- Establishing testing and development workflows

Check for updates to this file as the project evolves and gains more structure.
